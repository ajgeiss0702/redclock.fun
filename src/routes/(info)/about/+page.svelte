    <br>
    <br>
    This website is made to count down until the bell rings at your school.
    You can select which school you are at using the <a href="/schools">school selector</a>.<br>
    <br>
    This website was started at Red Mountain High School, but is slowly expanding to more schools.<br>
    Currently I am not adding new schools, but I am working on a system that will make it easy for students at
    schools to add their own schedule<br>
    <br>
    This website is currently maintained by one person, so sorry if there are issues.<br>
    If there are any issues, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:feedback@redclock.fun">feedback@redclock.fun</a>
